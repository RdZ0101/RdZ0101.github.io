        <h2>Programmer | Builder | AI </h2>
        <p>Currently i'm in my final year of Bachelor of Computer Science Degree Majoring in Artificial intelligece at Swinburne University of Technology. I've been a curious mind since childhood, which lead on my acedemic journey. As a hobby i built RC vehicles, circuits and eventually Arduino projects, This was a turning point in my life. At which point i was facinated by the idea of being able to create smarter machines with code. </p>
        <p>My personal ambition is to solve real world problems with code. Which is the main factor driving my passion for AI, data analysis, embeded software and IoT. However i consider myself a jack of all trades, with projects in various domains such as systems, web, database, networks and hardware.</p>
